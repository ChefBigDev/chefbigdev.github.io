LIVE AT: http://randomdriltweet.win

Simple website that randomly selects and displays one of Dril's*1 tweets.
The tweets.json have been generated through a php script, this is only possible on my private back-end since this website is fully front-end.

All tweets are collected in tweets.json. The JSON data will be updated every once in a while.
